## General info
This project was my first time working with Turtle and TKinter. Pong.py serves as a personal project for fun. It works as a simple pong game ran in the terminal that never ends but lets two users play against each other and tracks points scored by each player. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python (3.10.0)
* Visual Studio Code (1.63)
	
## Setup
Run in a prefered IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
